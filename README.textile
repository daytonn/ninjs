h2. About
Ninjs (No Inheritance Necessary) is a command line application written in ruby that leverages the "Sprockets":http://getsprockets.org JavaScript compiler to create modular javascript applications without having to compile your scripts manually. Ninjs also contains a very barebones JavaScript framework to enforce best practices like name-spacing and modular separation.

h2. Installation

You can install Ninjs using RubyGems. This is the easiest way of installing and recommended for most users.
<pre class="brush: sh;">
	$ gem install ninjs
</pre>

If you want to use the development code you should clone the Git repository and add the binary to your path:
<pre class="brush: sh">
	$ git clone git://github.com/textnotspeech/ninjs.git
	$ export PATH=/path/to/ninjs/bin:$PATH
</pre>
